        question: "A user inserts a DVD into their DVD optical drive, but the disc is unreadable. They have used the disk many times before without an issue. What is the MOST LIKELY cause of this error?<br><br>A) Scratched disk<br>B) Outdated drivers<br>C) Unclean disk<br>D) Optical drive malfunction",
        answer: "C) Unclean disk<br/><br/>Optical drives are vulnerable to dirt and lint. Cleaning them with appropriate cleaning solutions and lint-free towels should be your first step and will most likely fix the issue.<br/><br/>A scratched disk is less likely to occur than just getting dirt or lint. An optical drive malfunction is less likely, but could be ruled out by testing the drive with other disks. Outdated drivers are not likely to be an issue unless changes have been made to the system.",

        question: "After printing out a report on the company's laser printer, a user notices that there are ghost images of previous pages showing up. Which part of the printer should be replaced FIRST to address this issue?<br><br>A) Erasure lamps<br>B) Toner cartridge<br>C) Transfer corona<br>D) EP drum",
        answer: "B) Toner cartridge<br><br>Ghosting can be caused by a broken cleaning blade or malfunctioning erasure lamps. A broken cleaning blade can be addressed by replacing the toner cartridge, which is a cheaper option than replacing erasure lamps and therefore should be tried first.<br><br>A problem related to the EP drum is vertical black lines. A problem related to the transfer corona could be blank pages.",
